    <p>               <span>S</span>ustainable Development Goal 14 (SDG 14) is one of the 17 global goals set by the United Nations, to address pressing 
        social, economic, and environmental challenges worldwide. SDG 14, also known as "Life Below Water," is dedicated to the conservation and 
        sustainable use of the world's oceans, seas, and marine resources.</p>
 <div class="clear">
    <article>
        <h1>•Significance of SDG 14</h1>
        <p>
            Over 70% of the Earth's surface is oceans. They are very important for keeping the temperature stable, removing carbon dioxide from the air, <br>and giving millions of people a way to make a living. 
            Human actions, such as overfishing, pollution, habitat loss, and climate change,,<br> pose new threats to marine ecosystems that have never been seen before.
        </p>
        <P>
            SDG 14 recognises that seas are very important and wants to make sure that they are managed and protected in a way that benefits both current and future generations. SDG 14 aims to protect marine ecosystems and the services they provide to people by supporting 
            sustainable fisheries, lowering pollution, and dealing with the effects of climate change on the oceans.

            <h1>•Key Targets of SDG 14</h1>
            <p class="makebigger">
                SDG 14 comprises ten targets to be achieved by 2030, focusing on various aspects of ocean conservation and sustainable use. <br>These targets include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li class="List">Conservation of Marine Ecosystems: Protect and restore marine and coastal ecosystems, including coral reefs, mangroves, and seagrass beds, to enhance their resilience and biodiversity.</li>
                <li class="List">Sustainable Fisheries: To guarantee the sustainable exploitation of fish stocks, put an end to overfishing, illicit, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing, and damaging fishing methods. Instead, put science-based management plans into place.
                </li>
                <li class="List">Pollution Reduction: In order to protect marine life and ecosystems, reduce marine pollution coming from land-based sources such as sewage, plastic waste, and agricultural runoff.
                </li>
                <li class="List">Marine Protected Areas: To conserve biodiversity and improve ecosystem resilience, expand the reach of marine protected areas (MPAs) and other successful conservation strategies.</li>
                <li class="List">Ocean Acidification: Take action to stop ocean acidification, such as by conducting more in-depth study and implementing monitoring and mitigating strategies.</li>
                <li class="List">Ocean Governance: To combat illicit activity at sea, enhance maritime safety, and guarantee the fair sharing of marine resources, strengthen international cooperation and governance structures.</li>
                <li class="List">Public Awareness: Raise public knowledge of the value of oceans, the necessity of protecting them, and the part that each person and community can play in accomplishing SDG 14 aims.</li>

  <p class="text-1"><span>O</span>ceans cover more than 70% of the Earth's surface and are vital to the health and well-being of our planet. <br> 
    They play a crucial role in various aspects of life, including climate regulation, food security, biodiversity, and economic development</p>
<div class="clear">
    <ul>
        <li class="List">
            <b>Climate Regulation</b>
            <p class="inter-text">Oceans play a major role in controlling the climate system on Earth. They contribute to the regulation of global temperatures by absorbing a large portion of solar radiation. <br> 
                Furthermore, heat is carried around the planet by ocean currents, which affects regional temperatures and weather patterns. <br>
                The balance of greenhouse gases and the continuation of life on Earth depend on the exchange of gases, mainly carbon dioxide (CO2) and oxygen (O2), between the ocean and the atmosphere.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="List">
            <b>Food Security</b>
            <p class="inter-text">Food is a basic need for billions of people worldwide, and the oceans provide it. They sustain a range of marine ecosystems that yield fish, shellfish, and seaweed, among other types of seafood. <br>
                Human populations depend on fisheries and aquaculture for vital protein and nutrients, especially in coastal areas and emerging nations.  <br>
                To guarantee seafood's long-term availability and preserve food security for future generations, fisheries management must be sustainable.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li class="List"><b>Biodiversity</b>
            <p class="inter-text">From miniscule plankton to enormous whales, the ocean is home to a wide variety of marine life. <br>
                With ecosystems ranging from deep-sea trenches and polar regions to coral reefs and mangroves, they sustain tremendous levels of biodiversity. <br>
                In addition to being vital to the wellbeing of ocean ecosystems, marine biodiversity offers several advantages to people, <br>
                including ecological services like carbon sequestration, garbage breakdown, and nutrient cycling. The resilience and productivity of maritime ecosystems depend on the protection of marine biodiversity.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li class="List"><b>Economic Development</b>
            <p class="inter-text">Overseas economic development and activities are significantly influenced by the oceans. They provide help to many different industries, such as offshore energy production, tourism, fishing, and shipping. Particularly coastal regions are centres of economic activity, home to ports, resorts, and marine-related enterprises that support local economies by creating jobs and revenue. Ensuring the long-term sustainability of these industries and advancing equitable and inclusive economic development require sustainable management of ocean resources.</p>
